Size-recommendation, fitting, and virtual try-on App for Fashion E-Commerce.

== Description ==
ViuBox SYZ is a solution for Fashion E-Commerce websites to improve shopper experience by providing hyper-personalized services.

Users can sign up and then choose one of three methods available to create a digital version of themselves, a digital avatar. They may then use this digital avatar to check how each size of any item may fit their body proportions and to try on clothes, on the website, before buying. 

ViuBox SYZ also provides size recommendations based on the userâ€™s body proportions and the size charts of the brands available on the website. 

There are three ways users can create a digital avatar of themselves. The first method would be to visually modify the avatar that ViuBox has created for them based on the personal details that they had entered while signing up. They may adjust the avatar to match their body proportions. 

The second method is completely automatic, where ViuBox SYZ shall take the body measurements of users and create their avatar, all from a single picture of theirs that they upload. The picture uploaded has to be in A pose, that is, with arms at 45 degrees from the body. 

The third method is a manual one. Users may simply measure their body proportions and enter them one-by-one and save them. 

ViuBox SYZ comes with excellent user interface and experience. It provides users with multiple options, and is easy to use. It also packs a one-of-a-kind technology under its hood. 


Technical Details - 
When you install this plugin, we add code which places a "What's my size" button on your Woo Commerce sites product pages. This button allows
the user to open our custom app to receive their size recommendation and is linked with that specific products SKU code. 

The plugin also imports custom code from our servers which allows your website to load the ViuBox SYZ app with proper functionality.
We require you to receive this code from our servers since it allows us to update the app seamlessly in the background, with no intervention
from your side.

== Installation ==
Upload the .zip file to Wordpress Plugin Manager or download and enable the plugin from the plugin store to install it. No other steps are required.
